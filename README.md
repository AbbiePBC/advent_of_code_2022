## Advent of Code 2022

This repo contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2022, and is intended as a learning exercise for rust, rather than for optimising speed/memory.
The problems can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

### Usage

To run the programs for each day, do `$ cargo test --bin dec_01` __from the advent_2022 directory__.
This command compiles and runs the binary created from the path specified in the Cargo.toml.

To test, run `$ cargo run --bin dec_01`
